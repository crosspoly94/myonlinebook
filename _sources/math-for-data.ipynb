    "\n",
    "The mean is the average of the numbers.It is easy to calculate: add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are. In other words it is the sum divided by the count. Mathematically, the definion of the mean value can be explained by the following equaiton.\n",

The Disney dataset is composed of 5 tables, disney_movie_total_gross.csv, disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv, disney_characters.csv, disney_directors.csv, disney_voice_actors.csv. Each table is stored in a .csv file and contains different information about disney movies including genre, actors, directors, yearly gross income, and so forth.
